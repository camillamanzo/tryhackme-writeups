# SOC Fundamentals

## 🏢 Overview

A **Security Operations Centre (SOC)** is a dedicated team of security specialists that **continuously monitors** an organisation's network and resources to identify suspicious activity — 24/7.

## 👁️ Detection Areas

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Vulnerabilities** | Detection of weaknesses in systems or configurations |
| **Unauthorised Activity** | Detection of actions performed by attackers |
| **Policy Violations** | Detection of activity that doesn't conform with internal policies and rules |
| **Intrusion** | Detection of active exploitation by attackers |

## 🚨 Response

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Incident Response** | Steps taken to respond to, contain and recover from a detected incident |

## 👥 People

People in the SOC team are essential regardless of the level of automation in place.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **SOC Analyst L1** | First responders — perform basic triage and report detections |
| **SOC Analyst L2** | Deeper investigations — correlate data from multiple sources |
| **SOC Analyst L3** | Experienced threat hunters — proactively look for threat indicators |
| **Security Engineer** | Deploy and configure security solutions |
| **Detection Engineer** | Create the rules that power detection of harmful activities |
| **SOC Manager** | Manages the processes and workflows the team follows |

## ⚙️ Processes

### Alert Triage

Analyse alerts to determine severity and prioritise them using the **5 Ws**:

| W | Question |
|---|----------|
| **Who** | Who is involved? (source IP, user account, attacker) |
| **What** | What happened? (attack type, affected system) |
| **Where** | Where did it occur? (network segment, endpoint) |
| **When** | When did it happen? (timestamp, duration) |
| **Why** | Why did it happen? (motive, vulnerability exploited) |

### Reporting

A good incident report should cover the **5 Ws** alongside:
- Deep technical analysis
- Screenshots and evidence
- Timeline of events
- Recommended remediation

### Incident Response & Forensics

Combines active incident response with forensic investigation to **determine root cause** — not just stopping the attack, but understanding how and why it happened.

## 🛠️ Technology

Security solutions that minimise the SOC team's manual effort.

| Tool | Full Name | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **SIEM** | Security Information & Event Management | Collects and correlates logs from various devices across the environment |
| **EDR** | Endpoint Detection & Response | Provides detailed real-time and historical visibility into endpoint activity, with automated responses after detection |
| **Firewall** | — | Barrier between internal and external networks — monitors traffic and filters unauthorised connections |
